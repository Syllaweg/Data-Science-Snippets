# Data-Science-Snippets
Snippets of code to jump start Data Science projects. Not meant to replace the good old docs - just snippets to get started quick &amp; easy.

Why this repository exists?
I find it handy to keep a quick and easy bootstrap code for my ad-hoc analysis on github. Anytime i need to try a few algorithms on a data set - i simply replace a few lines and just visualize the data using off-the-shelf algos and it helps me figure out how much time & effort its going to take to work on a particular data-set.

How do I run it?
I have dumped sample files in each folder, sourced from various tutorials, etc

Future?
Although am as busy as another developer out there - i'll try updating the codes with newer and more in-depth changes that will make ingesting new data-sets easier than it is now. (its pretty easy right now)
